-Global Tracer Effect
Common\InitVehicle.sqs
Use new Fired-Effect System designed in 3.00.

Player\InitClient, InitPlayer, InitSpectator.sqs and Server\InitServer.sqs
Initialization are integrated in InitClient.sqs as 3.00 do.
(Player\StringWithoutVersion, FiredEH_Mortar.sqf, MsgEffectKilled... are just copied to make preprocessFile no error. They're not edited.)
(Player\InitStructureMarker.sqf is pasted too. But this might cause problem.)

Player\FiredEffect.sqf
Use "camCreate" command.
!!!!!!!! In 2.10 mod there's no "EffectBullet" thus use "Bizon_Bullet_xj200" instead. This bullet is in "FiredEffect_COC_Tracer" too.

Player\LimitWeaponRangeNew, ImpactPointMarker, TrackBullet, FiredEffect....sqs
Pasted 3.00 scripts without modification(ImpactPointMarker won't work since Upgrade Name changed.)



All "_xj300" are set "_xj200".
