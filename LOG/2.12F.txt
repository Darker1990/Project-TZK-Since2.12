======================================Bug Fixing======================================
There're some "__xj200" in scripts. They should be "_xj200".
But be cautious. This might cause problem. This error are in fired effect scripts. Old version didn't creating some kinds of bullets because reading wrong weapon name.


======================================Adjustment======================================
Add the dead tank burning effects. The creating and removing of game-logic is tested in 2.00 missions and no crash/stuck occured, thus he won't be the reason of problems.
