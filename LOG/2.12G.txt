Player\UpdateUnitMarkers.sqs
After having turned to #ResetLeaderMarker, the spectator should return to #UpdateSpectator, not #Update.

--Respawn
Having studied "https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/177209-ofpacwa-facts-myths-findings-experiments-prototypes-tutorials/?page=5&tab=comments#comment-3367239" by RozekPoland the author decide to fill protections of this in TZK missions. Some related settings about description.ext are modified as well.

Player\DynamicInitializationMarker.sqs
Those markers for "Respawn" is necessary for "respawn = 3".

Mission Root Folder
Add 3 empty scripts onPlayerRespawn.sqs, onPlayerResurrect.sqs and onflare.sqs.

Description.ext
Set "onLoadMissionTime = 1". However this seems is the default value thus make no sense.


--Killed Tank Effect
Creating Game-Logic in 2.10 MPMissions won't cause lags, proved. But effect will. The reason may because the scripts, using remote wreck object for "drop", and the sensor used for height getting is created by "createVehicle" and isn't deleted when script ends.


--CIV Dialog
Player\Dialog Spectator.sqs
Add "Radio" info in NVG text.


--Destruction
Common\InitStructureTypes.sqs
Add structsShelter definitions including wall, roof, tank trap, ammo crate, heli H, etc.

Player\UpdateDialogDestruction.sqf
Add structsShelter.

Player\Waiting For Destruction.sqs
If the type is in structsShelter, they'll be broken directly and gain 10% salvage.

--mission.sqm
Set all units using same ID, and delete all waypoints.
