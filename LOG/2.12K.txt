2.12J seems proved discontinous ID won't cause problem, but creaate/delete Group will.
However server no-response again, with only oversea ppls. The server's FPS is low in some situation, it might be the problem.

Discontinous ID should be edited, if server FPS no less than 30 but no-response again.



--Remove some sentences using SQF
UpdateTownGroup3.sqs, UpdateTownGroupRes(1-2).sqs
Actually those checking spawn/hibernate SQF might not causing problems. The problem should be too many RES/AI units.




Server\UpdateResPatrolGroup.sqs
Server somehow crashed after having played long. The reason might because res will go patrol after long. So the loop won't go patrol after time is big enough.
For those destroying tanks, they shouldn't use SQF as well.


======================================Bug Fixing======================================
There're 2 redundant items in Everon and Malden mission.sqm. Removed.
