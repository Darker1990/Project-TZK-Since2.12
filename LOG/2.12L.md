# Adjustment
## Server FPS
**2.12K** have FPS 14-15 with 15 ppls. Little improvement. There must exists other problems causing low FPS, i.e., global EH like Fired added on server and local checking. 2 ppls have 35 FPS, 7 ppls have about 28.

Adding/Removing EH don't require local arugment thus they can be operated when Join works. Fired-EH can thus be skipped on server when remote ppls' units created.


## LoadSettings
In InitPlayer this sentence is executed after game started 0.1 second. This should be moved into InitClient to make radio system working well for spectators.




## Equipment System
The design can be adjusted and improved.
### Dialog Adjustment.
#### 5-slot displaying support
The design of displaying general magazines can be improved, and applying SQF to refresh them.
Classify situations by the max magazine's size, called "mSize" below.
mSize >= 6 surely should be placed at the 2nd line and hide some slots on the 1st line.
mSize = 5 magazine is placed at the 1st line and the first slot in 2nd line will be hided. 
mSize = 4 magazine always placed in the 1st line.
For mSize = 3, if there're no less than two 3-slot magazines, two of them should be placed at the 2nd line. Otherwise 3-slot and the first 1-slot mag should placed at 1st line.
mSize <= 2 can just fill slots. No special situations.

Situations above can be further classified into 2 modes, corresponding to ascending or not. 
The order of magazines should be ascending unless mSize = 5, mSize = 4, or mSize = 3 with only **ONE** 3-slot mag.
**description.ext**
Adjust IDC and add some new image controls. Actually only 5-slot two images meaningful while others meaningless.
**Player\InitGUIControlIDs.sqs**
Keep IDC constants same as defined in description.ext
**Player\SQF\EquipmentUpdateImageGeneral.sqf**












**description.ext**
Add ClearTemplate button.




### Apply "find" in Equipment Searching/Matching.
**Common\InitEquipmentTypes.sqs**
Add 2 arrays, equipSearch and weaponSearch, to record the className and for searching(by "find" command supported since 1.99 CWA)



In 2.01 the slot, weapon type and picture can be readed from its definition in CONFIG.



With the help of magazinesarray and ammoarray the condition of units equipment is able to be judged.
magazinesArray unit;
unit ammoarray muzzleName; -> returning an array with all modes and counts, e.g. <grenadier> ammoarray "ak74muzzle" will return `["ak74", 30, "ak74", 30, "ak74", 30]`, corresponding to 3 modes of AK74. This command is case-insensitive.
