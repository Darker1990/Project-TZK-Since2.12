# Adjustment
## Server FPS
**2.12K** have FPS 14-15 with 15 ppls. Little improvement. There must exists other problems causing low FPS, i.e., global EH like Fired added on server and local checking. 2 ppls have 35 FPS, 7 ppls have about 28.

Adding/Removing EH don't require local arugment thus they can be operated when Join works. Fired-EH can thus be skipped on server when remote ppls' units created.
**Server\EventAdd_Infantry.sqs**
Add EH to server soldiers only, for trial.
`? !local _unit : exit`

## Island
The mission in island ctiland3 is recovered. Teleporter bridge added.


## CIV NVG/Radio Function
The usage of NVG can be realised by "action".
Add a "quit" button to exit the dialog and call the radio. Spectator can use radio to return the dialog.
**Player\Radio\Radio_Update_Vehicle_Common.sqf.sqs**
For spectator, channel 0-0-0 can return to spectator mode.
**description.ext**
Add "QUIT" button to exit the spectator mode.
**Player\Dialog Spectator.sqs**
The button "NVG" will just switch NVG ON/OFF.


## LoadSettings
In InitPlayer this sentence is executed after game started 0.1 second. This should be moved into **InitClient.sqs** to make radio system working well for spectators.
Equipment Template initialization should be moved to **InitClient.sqs** as well.


## Equipment System
The design can be adjusted and improved.
### Dialog Adjustment.
#### 5-slot and 3-slot displaying support
The design of displaying general magazines can be improved, and applying SQF to refresh them.
Classify situations by the max magazine's size, called "mSize" below.
mSize >= 6 surely should be placed at the 2nd line and hide some slots on the 1st line.
mSize = 5 magazine is placed at the 1st line and the first slot in 2nd line will be hided. 
mSize = 4 magazine always placed in the 1st line.
For mSize = 3, if there're just two 3-slot magazines, they should be placed at the 2nd line. Otherwise a 3-slot mag and the first 1-slot mag should be placed at 1st line.
mSize <= 2 can just fill slots.

Situations above can be further classified into 2 modes, corresponding to ascending or not. 
The order of magazines should be ascending unless mSize = 5, mSize = 4, or mSize = 3 with only **ONE** 3-slot mag.
**description.ext**
Adjust IDC and add some new image controls. Actually only 5-slot two images meaningful while others meaningless.
**Player\InitGUIControlIDs.sqs**
Keep IDC constants same as defined in description.ext
**Player\Dialog Equipment.sqs**
Magazines need only be well sorted.
**Player\SQF\EquipmentUpdateImageGeneral.sqf**
After having sorted magazines, they can simply be placed in slots. The only 2 meaningful images is those 5-slot ones.

##### Something about "Dialog Equipment.sqs" before modified
3-elements array _equipment is used to record magazines.
The initialization of weapons and magazines is depending on weaponDefs and equipDefs

Information of templ or custom is loaded.
(Clear button here)

**Main Loop**
If information loaded, update the pictures(goto "UpdateImage").
If weapons changed, read their info and goto "UpdateImage".
Calculate the cost.

Read button status.
**#Add/Rem Items**
Read magazine's size and type. If slots remain no less than magazine's size, a new element will be added into corresponding row of _equipment and goto "UpdateImage".

**#UpdateImage**
Read weapon info
Sorting rows of _equipment first by the magazines' type then by their size. Ascending order is default unless there exists two 4-slot magazines.
(5-slot and 3-slot supporting here)
Clear images, read magazines' info in order and display. An "empty" picture will show for those not occupied slots.

#### Clear Template of Equipment and Custom Soldier
If save "no equipment" the element of eqTemplates and infCustom should be "[]". Unnecessary to add a "Clear" button.
**Player\LoadSettings.sqs**
Add condition `if !((_templ select 1) == -1 && (_templ select 2) == -1 && (_templ select 3) == -1 && count ((_templ select 4) select isGeneral) + count ((_templ select 4) select isHandgun) + count ((_templ select 4) select isOptics) == 0 )`.
**Player\Dialog Equipment.sqs**
Add similar condition as well.


### Apply "find" in Equipment Searching/Matching.
**Common\InitEquipmentTypes.sqs**
Add 2 arrays, equipSearch and weaponSearch, to record the className and for searching(by "find" command supported since 1.99 CWA).


### GetWeaponParam
The slots a magazine occupying, the type of weapon(primary, secondary, etc) and its pictures can be read from CONFIG.
**NOT Apply to Dialog Equipment Directly yet.**

#### Cost of Equipment
When player buying equipments, he should pay for items new added. And equipments equipped before buying should be sold and gain 50% of its price.
It's necessary to record equipments on start and respawn. They value $0.
##### Recording Respawn Equipment
**Player\InitPlayer.sqs**
Define RespawnEquipment array with 2 rows and a corresponding boolean **before** executing **EquipPlayerRespawn.sqs**. **BE AWARE** that optics is treated as magazines in Dialog Equipment.
**Player\Dialog Equipment.sqs**
At #EquipAndExit, _costFactor is used to record the purchase on game start.
**Player\EquipPlayerRespawn.sqs"**
After finished equipping, the weapons and magazines are recorded by RespawnEquipment and RespawnSalvage will set false.
##### Reset the boolean after having bought once
**Player\EquipPlayerRespawn.sqs"**
The RespawnSalvage should be true if having bought at `_costFactor > 0`.
##### Calculate the charge
When having updated the image of equipments, the cost can be calculated by weapons of players right now, the bool RespawnSalvage and equipments displaying.



With the help of magazinesarray and ammoarray the condition of units equipment is able to be judged.
magazinesArray unit;
unit ammoarray muzzleName; -> returning an array with all modes and counts, e.g. <grenadier> ammoarray "ak74muzzle" will return `["ak74", 30, "ak74", 30, "ak74", 30]`, corresponding to 3 modes of AK74. This command is case-insensitive.
