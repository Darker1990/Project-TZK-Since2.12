### Extend Satchel/Mine
#### Counting Satchel/Mine
MagazinesArray is necessary to exclude those exhausted mags. It's still necessary to use "magazines" directly to check "magazine num after put".
#### Using Satchel/Mine
Use a local variable to record magazine going to be put.

#### Scripts
In player's script, it's necessary to check magazines both in rearmData and being carried.



### Rearm Cost
Write SQF to calculate the rearm cost for soldiers. Aware that "in" and "find" is case-sensitive for string.

In Server\AI_Rearm, Player\Rearm and Player\RearmAir, the cost is calculated by SQF.
