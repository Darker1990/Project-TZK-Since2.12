# Mission
Add Training Mission in Freya Island.

# After Burner
Add magazine in scripts.

Recover the radio of planes.

# EventHandlers
It's unnecessary to pre-define EH in MOD unless those EH are "Init" and inconvenient to be "publicVariable", or are of the kind that will be removed by Mission scripts. Besides, mostly EH are global, and if add them in mission on players' clients only, the burden of server might be reduce.

## Init.sqs
Change the upgrade **upgTrackArtBullet** to **upgTraceSpecialShell**.
## InitStructureTypes
Add Marker definitions (but not be used yet). Adjust pictures' path (so do icon in images). Apply new Mortar/M46 and add their EH for player. Adjust arrays for Occupy order.
