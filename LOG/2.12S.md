Set loop 30 seconds. The action ["REFUEL",_object] is good but not enough in OFP.

# Unit's Factory Info and Attach System
The attach system in 1.96/1.99 missions relying on the factory where a unit is created. However the core factor should be the mass. Besides, some unit in **InitUnitTypes** are allowed to be created by multi factories, and some of them thus can't be attached.
## Dialog AttachVehicle.sqs
Set mass limit. 9999 for Truck, 6000 for Helicopter. No limit for APC and tanks. Actually about 40000 for C130 and An12, and the ability of UH60/Mi17 is different. However their UA are same, using ttHeli all.
