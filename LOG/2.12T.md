# Equip/Units
Remove all "M16_xj200" and "M4_xj200" weapons. Add Mortar for east in **InitUnitTypes.sqs** and **Init.sqs**.
## AI Rearm Check
Using GetWeaponParamArray and GetWeaponSubParamArray to check none-empty magazines and available magazines of a weapon. For those equipping secondary weapon units, their primary weapon won't be check, in order to reduce server's burden. Of course an AT soldier whose secondary weapon being taken won't go rearm in this situation but AI leader will never ask its member to drop the launcher. Those units, used to belong to player's group and joined AI group after its launcher having been taken by player, won't go rearm.


# Files of other branches.
All of them are arranged. Most of them have been transplanted. Remove some abandoned files.


# Distributed Checking Town Spawn
This is totally a trial.

In CTI MPMissions now, the more players, the less Server FPS. Town Groups' spawn/hibernate keep on checking units' position. This setting is suspecious, since server keep on loading remote units' position. So it's deserve to test whether asking clients to check their local units only and broadcast message will partly improve the FPS.
## Initialize Variables
In **Init.sqs** and **InitPublicVariables.sqs** variables are initiailzed. pv variables using bool. Player clients (including the server created by player directly) using arrays to record flagCarriers and towns' index.
## Public Variables (called "pv" for short when talking about variables)
Players should always broadcast "true". If "true" then res town will be activated, and hibernate town will spawn. Activated town will hibernate only when no true message received.

Server will check whether public variables true. If true it'll activate/deactivate towns, otherwise it'll check AI groups. TG for west/east already use the info to send message, and thus can add settings here to inform clients that town's status (spawn/hibernate) changed. As for resistance towns, it's necessary to ask server broadcast public variable as well, to release clients' checking that town.
## Check Res Town
On game start clients and server will pre-edit data, namely exclude those towns close to start position (2 game logic placed in mission.sqm). Clients will check whether his members close enough to a flagCarrier, and send message if true. Clients will check pv and undefine those "true" and corresponding elements in townsRes[].

Server will check pv first. And if server units activate one town, server will broadcast the pv.
## Check WEST/EAST TG
Clients will check enemy's town.
