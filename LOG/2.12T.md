# Equip/Units
Remove all "M16_xj200" and "M4_xj200" weapons. Add Mortar for east in **InitUnitTypes.sqs** and **Init.sqs**.
## AI Rearm Check
Using GetWeaponParamArray and GetWeaponSubParamArray to check none-empty magazines and available magazines of a weapon. For those equipping secondary weapon units, their primary weapon won't be check, in order to reduce server's burden. Of course an AT soldier whose secondary weapon being taken won't go rearm in this situation but AI leader will never ask its member to drop the launcher. Those units, used to belong to player's group and joined AI group after its launcher having been taken by player, won't go rearm.
