# Event Handler
Although the effect of the "IncomingMissile" EventHandler is "Global", this EventHandler will be triggered by its local missile only. Namely if client A add an IncomingMissile EH to a vehicle local to A, while B don't add IncomingMissile EH , and a missile shot by a unit local to B client targeting object local to A with an IncomingMissile EH, the EH won't be triggered.

Thus the EH must be added on all clients. On dedicated server the "command" parameter can be empty string, but the EH can't be omitted.
## Spoof Missile
Visual effects shouldn't be executed on server.
# Fix Bug of "GetUnitMarker.sqf"
The string of remote units will be ended by " REMOTE". It should be removed.
# Add cannon to 4xAA
If cannon won't affect their attacking aircrafts by missile, the cannon should be added to them. 
# T80 Model
Introduce T80 units with drum display switch.
# Killed Tank Effect
Introduce Killed Tank Effect. Resistance tank will use logic to broadcast.
# New Mission on usmc_gaia
