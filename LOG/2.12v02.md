# Equip
## Upgrade of 4xAA
Optimize the EditRearmData series scripts.  
Set upgrades of 4xAA edit existing units' magazines (via 2.01 support commands, ammoArray/magazinesArray/addMagazinePrecise). 
## Bugs of upgrades
Old scripts judge situation by reading value from matrix directly. This causing existing unit double their magazines everytime when new upgrade happen.  
## Cannon of 4xAA
Remove cannon of 4xAA added in v01. The cost of RedTop missile is same as AA, namely 20,000, meanwhile the cost of bullet4x20 is only 30. AI almost never use missile unless the cost is adjusted.  
# Temporary Order
## All
Add "All" for Temporary Order system. Adjust the dialog, send/msg by double the constant "GroupsNum".  
"All" is invalid for those groups whose "order lock" is ON.  
## Sabot/Heat Switch Temporary Order
Add temporary order to control AI groups switch Sabot/Heat. There isn't "reload magazine" action for AI by script in OFP, thus use ammoArray/magazinesArray/addMagazinePrecise commands again here.  
Only gunner activate this order. Script will halt if vehicle is remote.  
## Scripts' Path
All Order/OrderTemp scripts are moved into a subfolder of "Server".  
## Bugs of Index
Some ordertemp scripts have bug in their "index" and are fixed this time.  
# Howitzer
Adjust howitzer from "fixed turret" to "limited turret".  
# Killed Tank Effect
Refering to "MsgUnitBuilt", the number of "Msg" scripts for killed-tank are 5 as well. And resistance tank using game-logic pre-set by MOD to broadcast their death.  
# ShowPad
Aiming to get avoid of bug that notepad not displaying, the options about pad is added in TZK_Mission_Setting Dialog as well.  
# Marker
The marker displaying in dev mode of enemy vehicles and structures is conflict to dev-off mode. Scripts should thus be closed in dev mode.
