+ Server Burden
	+ "find" command. The "getIndex.SQF" is replaced by "find". However if apply "find" in other SQF files, the burden seems not be reduced.
		 + AddRearmData, EditRearmData: They're modified not to rely on SQF.
		 + GetRearmData„ÄÅGetUnitTypeFromObject: Since they're widely used, they're not removed. Decouple them with many scripts, the **funcGetUnitTypeFromObject** on server will be used by Order and OrderTemp SQS scritps.
		 + In GetUnitTypeFromObject.SQF, copying array but not address requiring a **+** operator.
	+ RES patrol group script
		+ Decouple **UpdateResPatrolGroup.sqs** with SQF. Group's command will all be done by SQS.
		+ The patrol position will be roll and judged by SQS as well, with a 0.1 second delay.
	+ Remove CheckDetachedVehicles script from **UpdateServer.sqs**. There'is *call back MHQ* radio channel for COMMANDER and don't have to use this.
+ In **AddWorker.sqs**, it's necessary to use the *tug*'s position to deploy workers when MHQ is attached.
+ In **InitUnitTypes.sqs**, the displaying name of howitzer is changed (from *fixed* to *limited*). Adjust the texture's path of ka50.paa, and remove the paa file from **Player**.
+ Fix the bug that *_xj301* remain in Equip script of Mortar soldier.
+ Shoot Target
	+ Create 20 markers for shooting. 10 of them are for AI groups, but they're not made yet. In **InitPlayer.sqs** 10 invisible "H" are *camCreate*-ed.
	+ Add **Set/Clear Target** and **Shoot Target** for player group commanding. They're available for tank, howitzer, art tank, mortar structure and M46 filedgun. The author tried to add Mortar soldiers in this design, however "fire" script command for soldier is useless (soldier will always aim up in the air before firing).
	+ Rename all order scripts under **Player**. They're placed in **Player\Order** now.
+ ShowPad and ShowGPS should be added into **UpdateSpectator.sqs**.
+ Missing semicolon in MappingSpectator.sqf are added.
