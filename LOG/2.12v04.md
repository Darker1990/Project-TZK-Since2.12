## 2.12 v04
Dialog TZK Setting
+ The "_last" array should response to the change of some options.
+ Set **Player\Info\GroupIsAI.sqs** rename the leader's marker.

Set sdDist of Light Factory as 35 (same as Air's), aiming to make plane not be blocked by the structure.

String and SQF files.
+ <s>Modify some lightly SQF into string.</s>
	+ Abandoned in v08. No feeling of improvement.
+ Remove some SQF files.
	+ AddToUnitMatrix.sqf is for searching index. We have find now.
	+ AddToStructMatrix.sqf is removed. See below.
	+ The money calculating on server don't use SQF any longer.
		+ The mutex in InitUnitFactory should be filled up.
	+ GetIdleFactory.sqf.
+ Adjust some string and SQF files.
	+ *grpSetting* often report error. It's widely used and can hardly be located. Thus it's removed in all *.SQF files.
	+ The dot product of vector don't support 3D-vector. This is fixed.
	+ String can receive parameters as well. Some of them are modified in this way.

Structures Design.  
This adjust is aiming for optimize auto-buy.
+ The very first principle: Although mostly structures won't explode and died again like vehicles when being *setDamage 0*, we should still insist using new object replace ruined old one.
+ StructMatrix
	+ Since we insist to "replace" old one, we can't apply "find" to the object gong to be removed on remote client, because lag might exist in MP games.
	+ The building of structure is made by server. Thus we should broadcast index as well when broadcasting the sturcture.
	+ In this way we don't plan to remove "objNull" in the front of arrays. The size of array thus possible be unlimited.
		+ Factories' number is limited. Thus we should only pay attention to other structures like wall or roof. Their order is unimportant and we can fill structures from the beginning of the array.
	+ AddToStructMatrix
		+ Structure will be added only in **BuildStruct.sqf** and **StructuresServerRemove.sqs**. New design requiring broadcast index as well.
		+ Removing structure in **ReplacePrimStruct** needs delay since we need to *find* old one to get its index.
			+ Make use of **DeleteVehicleAfterDelay.sqs**.
			+ Executing **StructuresServerRemove** in the end, getting old object's  index and set new object in the matrix (using mutex at this step). Pass the index to broadcasting script.
			+ Abandon writing into matrix in **StructuresServerRemove**. Move the old structure out of the map and delete it after 10 seconds.
		+ Record the index at higher digit than si in **SendStructBuilt**. If passing -1 as index, the index will be the size of current array.
		+ Structures whose type recorded in structsShelter will fill the first objNull found in array.
	+ SendStructMatrixRemove.sqs
		+ Since player only receive the index and set the element directly, and the effect of deleteVehicle is global, it's unnecessary to remove objNull from matrix on players' client.
		+ Abandon the executing of **SendStructMatrixRemove.sqs**.
+ The *structuresServer* array on server.
	+ This array is for remove other components when main structure being deleted.
	+ Aiming to apply "find" command, it should be decoupled into 2 arrays.
	+ Adjust corresponding scripts.
+ The *repairableStructureMatrix* matrix on server.
	+ This matrix is for structures need repair. Old design using SQF files to repair them. It would be better to use SQS files combining with mutex.
		+ Old design will delete the destroyed structure immediately when it's repaired. Since new design remove the structure from matrix but not delete it immediately, error will occur. Thus modification is necessary.
	+ Decouple the matrix to fit "find" command, define a new *repairableStructureInfo* array.
		+ Aiming to make workers repair structures in order, new destroyed one should be added in the end. A new SQF is required to search objNull from the end.
	+ Modify RepairStructure.sqf into SQS syntax. The codes is executed by worker and support vehicles. mutexRepairStructure is taken form ReplacePrimStruct to their scripts.
		+ The codes will "set" objNull to repairableSturcture when having repaired the structure, unlike old design which wait till old structure being deleted.
	+ Other relating scripts' modifications.
	
AI auto-buy
+ New design of StructMatrix make the repaired factory's order not changed. This make auto-buy unnecessary to adjust setting if a factory once destroyed but soon repaired.
+ In **UpdateLeader.sqs** the auto-buy script will be executed on each 5 seconds. Since server FPS might reduce to 6 or 5, it's better transplanting codes into **UpdateLeader.sqs.**
	+ For groups being set auto-buy factory, it'll always buy from the factory whose index same as being set in setting.
		+ The index of factories is fixed. Ruined factory won't be replaced by next one, unless it's destructured or disappeared because of not repaired for long.
	+ The random number for "select" should minus 0.5.
		+ An array in OFP whose size is "a" can ***select a***, but the return value is nil.
		+ 0.5 is special for "select". It's not rounding as common sense. Selecting .5 is equivalent to selecting closest **even (not odd)** number.
			+ Since 0 <= random x < x, selecting (ramdom x - 0.5) is always legal, when x is the size of the array.
+ Set AICO will buy special units when dev is true and getworld == "eden", for experiment.
	
AI order system.
+ Abandon the minus and applying "find" with "set" when removing elements from arrays of busy and temporary. So do "*CheckSupportUnits* array.
+ Use pointer to optimize the scripts of aiSetting, orderMatrix and orderTempMatrix. 
	+ Define a local pointer pointing orderMatrix select _si select _gi, etc.
+ Turn off the hit-EH of AI infantry. Remain the Fired-EH.

AI satchel. This is a trial when exploring the reason causing "no-response" server. Problem is solved in v08 version.

Add delay in Town Group script and resistance patrol group script.
+ Not proved, but it seems not bad adding delay in ergodic parts.

Overlap function.
+ This function is unnecessary. One can simply use *"_x in A" count B > 0* to judge whether A and B have same element.

Dialog Spectator.
+ Add bFreeMode in **InitSpectator.sqs** for spectator's 1st mode.
+ In the "#Quit" part of **Dialog Spectator.sqs**, use switchCamera to switch camera to player, use cameraEffect to take control, and set 1 second delay.
	+ If lacking cameraEffect player can't control its role.
	+ If lacking delay the camera switch might error and missing target.
	+ In OFP the camera is on for player, thus can't turn off all cameras (by "terminate" parameter).
		+ *Bug in right upper corner, the groups list, has been fixed in v08 version.*
+ **UpdateSpectator.sqs**
	+ Variable "_posFreeMove" is for recording position in 1st mode. It's initialized as player's start position. It'll be recorded when exiting 1st mode and used for place player on next time entering 1st mode.
	+ Add a condition in main loop after condition of gameOver and alive to pause position reseting.
	+ Not allow spectator enter any vehicle in 1st mode in order to avoid spectator affect the game.
	+ Keep on removing spectator's weapon in 1st mode.
