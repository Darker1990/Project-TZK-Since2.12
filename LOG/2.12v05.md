## 2.12 v05
Happened to discover that the cycling script, keep on using "goto", will lag the server, and modify it to pass status to new script and terminate old one can partly raise Server FPS.
Create "Start" and "Loop" folder for scripts.
+ resistance patrol groups.
	+ **DynamicInitializationGroup** execute the script in Start folder.
		+ Recover the script design, remove those trial settings in recent versions.
		  Using loadFile to gain start pos and patrol pos. Set SQF roll position at most 112 times.
		  In destroy part the group will halt for a period, if enemy structure is far away and all towns is occupying by resistance.
		  In destroy and take town part the "forEach" is abandoned and "goto" with 2s delay is applied for all units of group.
			+ Probably delay is necessary, or server might crash.
		+ Create a new script **Common\DelayMove.sqs** for resistance tank in destroy part. They'll first shoot then move, to make their attacking base more precisely.

Apply the loop design for other scripts. However this can't completely raise server FPS to keep mostly at about 60.
New design, with only resistance patrol groups, can keep FPS at about 60. If AI's 18×2 groups doing simple order the FPS is still high, but complex order still will reduce it.
Delay is necessary for loop scripts in the beginning, to make old ones exit and release resources.
+ AI Order scripts.
*Abandoned. They'll be restart if leader update the order.*
+ AI Leader scripts
	+ Pass status to new script every 3 minutes.
+ <c>AICO script.</c>
	+ Too many status for this script thus give up it's modification in this way in v08, and use old design.
+ KnowsAbout
+ Town Group
+ InitUnitFactory.sqs
+ worker and support vehicle script
+ Server script
	+ UpdateServer, UpdateIncome

Those cycling scripts on Player client should be modified as well. Some player's game often crash, and the reason might related to cycling script.
Besides, the camera of spectator become not smooth when game started for a while, and the reason may be same.
	+ UpdatePlayer(Spectator)，UpdatePlayerVehicle。
	+ Marker scripts.
		+ The feeling that map dragging and camera moving do become smoother.
		+ *But even though modify all scripts of spectator into loop mode, the whole game of spectator will be not smooth after having played tens of minutes.*

Server FPS will decrease with the increasing of players' number. Try to decouple knowsAbout design, ask player to calculate how its group knowsAbout other units.
+ <c>The change of Server FPS can't be felt thus this design and activating town is removed in v08. Server is still asked to check all units including players'.</c>

Set unit as the parameter of string of busy and temporary.
+ *This cause brackets required by "not" command, or error occur. This bug is fixed in v06.*

Add group name in the end of leader marker when choosing displaying player's name, and the color is set to be orange.
Add IDC of NVG and QUIT button of spectator in **InitGUIControlIDs.sqs**.
Recover the model of T80_TZK.
Move those codes of AI Order and Setting from **Init.sqs** to individual script in Common.
