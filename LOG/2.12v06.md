## 2.12 v06
Bug fixing
+ Since busyCheck and temporaryCheck accept unit as its parameter, brackets is required between "not" command and other parts, or error will occur.
	+ This bug invalid all temporary order scripts.
+ Money bug.
	+ <s>Attempts in v06 is invalid, and is removed in v07.</s>
	+ The author thought the problem was because 2 public variable is used and the message script only "@" 1 variable.
		+ Although this isn't the source of the problem, this design is meaningful and thus be remained.
	
Adjust the radius parameter of Reclaim order to "response radius". Soldiers farther than this radius won't response to this order.
+ It would be better to set 2 radius for response and for empty vehicle range. But we've exhause our parameters.

Adjust syntax of 3 Money scripts. However this is meaningless.

Adjust UpdateWeather and TimeBoost script.
+ Although BIKI claim that "SkipTime" and many weather command has global effect, they have only local effect.
+ *This still require a calibration design, sending by server.*
	
<s>Adjust knowsAbout.</s> This design is canceled in v08.

Turn the script on server detecting whether player is disconnected into "loop" design.
+ And this still didn't solve the problem of Server FPS.
