## 2.12 v08
Remove portable satchel in server scripts.
+ Remove the usage of portable satchel in AI_CheckDropBomb. In order scripts only check whether AI have "magSatchel".
+ Units join the server via "Join" design or because of player's disconnecting will be cleaned up its portable satchel.
+ Remove the portable satchel from soldiers' equipping scripts and AI leader's equipment. EAST sniper AT soldier equipping SVU-A instead of SVD.
+ Portable satchel is still available to players' group.

Adjust Res and Town Groups.
+ Recover their design, mostly modified since v04 for experiments. The period of loop is assigned as 30 seconds without random.
	+ Delay is remained in those ergodic parts.
+ Adjust the hibernate design. Unnecessary to delete units/vehicles, instead, repeatedly creating and deleting may be more expensive.
	+ Create some markers on players' clients.
	+ When players received the hibernate/spawn info, those markers will be placed/removed at the town flag to indicate the town is safe zone or not.
		+ Markers are available to CIV as well.
	+ When hibernate, TG will receive reinforce as general. When reinforce ready, TG will return to the hibernate check and do nothing but just halt.

Adjust the LOOP design.
The author found the "crash" (not no-response) problem become more frequent when applying loop design. 
After having add delay on the beginning of loop scripts the problem solved. Probably the release of last script cost some time.

The script of AI_Commander still use old design without loop.
Adjust the way AICO buy units in dev mode (dev ON in training MPMissions in everon and Freya_CTI island).

Adjust of AICO
+ The author found AI seldom stay home when loop design applied.
+ However on destroy part AI groups still can't do the "patrol co9 (whose position is at enemy MHQ)" well.
	+ They still have to be asked go to the closest town to enemy MHQ.
	+ Old design using a bool variable, which is binary. New design use a number and adjust the design into ternary.

*(This part is the by-product of researching "no-response" problem. Modifications here aiming to improve the mission. Although they probably don't relate to that problem, they're valid for some improvements and thus are remained.)*
The author use "setFriend" command of 2.01 and found the "no-response" won't appear if nobody killing each other.
The reason is no one will attack by portable satchel. However, the author used to thought the reason is because of too long unitMatrix/RearmData array.
+ The adjust of UnitMatrix is abandoned.
+ The adjust of RearmData is remained. Traditional design use a long array to record ALL units created in CTI.
	+ A unit with fixed type has a fixed equipment. Thus we can design an empty array whose size same as "unitDefs" to restore the equipment of each type.
		+ The elements of this array, "rDataMatrix", is array.
			+ The format of the element array is "[id, weapons[], magazines[]]"ï¼Œthe No.0 element indicates the priority.
		+ The **AddRearmData.sqs** will write data with priority "0".
		+ The **Equip** scripts will write data with priority "1".
		+ The **UpgState** script will write data with priority "2".
		+ Empty array will always be wrote. Otherwise the script will check the priority. Only when priority is "2", or priority more than existed data, will the script write.
	+ Units with undefined type (group leaders), custom soldiers and structures will use traditional design, i.e., be recorded into a long array (which won't be so long as before).
		+ They'll be distinguished by **AddRearmData**, if it received more than 1 parameters, and the second one means "type" of unitDefs.
	+ The record of resistance soldiers into RearmData is canceled. And only west/east town vehicles' equipment data will be writed by "EditEquipRearmData".
	+ Adjust **EditEquipRearmData.sqs** and **EditRearmdata.sqs** to fit new design.
	+ Adjust **GetRearmData** to fit new design. Many scripts using SQS syntax to get RearmData are recovered to use SQF as well.
	
Adjust the briefing.html. Parts of texts using handwriting.
Remove the reducing of DOOM.
Use "EffectBullet0_xj200" bullet for Fired Effects instead of Bizon bullet.
Recover those functions from string to SQF. No obvious signs that string is better than SQF and help solving "no-response" problem.
Fix the bug in dialog Equipment that missed loading Binocular and NVG.
Removed the hint when worker repairing structures set in v07.
Set Town Triggers' scripts as loop design. Attention, the "closestTown"'s side shouldn't be assigned as "siRes" only like before.
Remove some SQS syntax searching unit's type. Recover the usage of SQF.
Fix the "buy better NVG" channel. The binocular and NVG is removed from magazines and be treated as weapons in equipment system, but this script didn't adjusted.
Fix the KnowsAbout scripts using wrong variable name.
Set RallyPoint and PickupWait of AI as loop design. The number of their setting is passed in as a parameter. Set PickupWait don't keep on doing busySet and busyClear.
In dialog spectator, the carrying system using 15 for groups and thus causing bug. It's adjusted and using "GroupsNum" now.
Set a bool for CIV to turn ON/OFF the markers displaying. This bool can be set by marker in dialog or by 0-0-9 channel in 1st mode.
Managed to realize the 1st mode. "switchCamera", "cameraeffect" and delay is necessary.

Next step the author will mainly research the Server FPS. And the author now know how to test misisons better.
