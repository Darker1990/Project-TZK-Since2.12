#External MODs
There're some bool variables defined in mission.sqm and standardized in init.sqs to control the mode of TZK mission.  
dev: Missions for developer to test and for player to get familiar with new designs quickly.  
bool_TZK_Vanilla_Mode: Missions relying TZK AddOns only on TZK_Objects.pbo (and subsequent config pbos).  
bool_TZK_199_Mode: Missions for 1.99 version. It shall control script commands.  
bool_TZK_MF_Mode: Missions for mfcti mod.  
bool_TZK_Yugo_Mode: Missions for totalYugoWar mod.  
bool_TZK_SEMod_Mode: Missions for TZK_SE mod.  
boole_Infantry_Mode: Missions with infantry-only mode. It's not widely applied.  
##4.0.4.05
+ bool_TZK_199_Mode decouple and redefine (if game is on 2.01, reassign the bool_TZK_199_Mode value and make the game using 2.01 script commands).
	+ Need decouple bool_TZK_199_Mode with other mods. This bool shall indicate only the version but not actual mod like mfcti/totalYugoWar.
		+ Scripts checked. However many of them are contained in AddOns. By now 1.99 missions can't apply 2.01 feature under 2.01 game on those scripts.
			+ Critical scripts, unit/structure/equip, are started by init.sqs and prepared entrance for them.
		+ The special NVG is available in 2.01 game. But it isn't contained in yugo mod equipment list in earlier version. By now it's filled.
		+ **Need check stability in 1.99 game.**
			+ New anim change for soldier rapid rearm shouldn't contained in 1.99 version.
	+ Need a method to remove 1.99 radio/town sensors and thousands of markers.
		+ Markers done. deleteMarker available.
			+ Markers in mission.sqm about TZK info, town name and teleporter shall be standardized and renamed. **"remain_marker"** should be renamed and removed by 2.01 script.
				+ **MarkerTownName, MarkerTeleporter**.
		+ Sensor done. Their "name" is reversed and can't be assigned in-game. Name of trigger is required since its statement is global. Rename them using extra "Dym" prefix.
+ bool_TZK_Yugo_Mode update.
  When bool_TZK_Yugo_Mode = true, the mission will execute unit/structure script via extra folder. In this way it's unnecessary to remake the 4.0.5 mod.
##4.0.4.04
Hide T55/M60-120S in vanilla modes and recover BIS M60/T72 there.
#Scripts in AddOns
**Check the date files modified isn't good since "git checkout" applied. All of them shall be modified directly, or try compare 2 versions.**
+ Player\DynamicInitializationMarker
	+ Remove 1.99 markers. Correctly define "mod" marker. If not 1.99, create other markers for mf/totalYugoWar.
+ **Common\DelayCode.sqs**
	+ In 4.0.5 mod a new "delay" subfolder should be created under "Common".
#Units

##4.0.4.04
+ Replace no-radar helicopters with radar version in basic TZK design (no modification in SE external scripts).

#Join and "_gi"
'_set = aiSetting select _si select _gi select# _ais': Error Zero divisor  
It's of rallyPoint script. '_gi' is reassigned by find command. This occur on kaos@MF version, player-server and AICO, player ask AI group join player. Maybe join and gi have errors.  
rallyPoint problem solved. If _gi == -1 then script will sleep, and quit if this last for 2 minutes.  
**Join and order not refreshed on player-server remain unsolved.**
