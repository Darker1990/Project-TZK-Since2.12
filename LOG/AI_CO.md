There're less and less CTI player in OFP by now. So I do something to improve AI Commander (or say, AICO). In old CRCTI AICO has 10 times start money (namely $400,000 in most cases), and in TZK The player Inspektor request for more stronger tank platoons. However that's not good enough design. I'll first try make AICO able to do something useful but not only building tanks.

# AI Groups
I plan to make AICO have 3 directions using tanks. Then I plan to use 4th group as transport group using helicopter. The 5th and 6th groups are for infantry. Other groups will be filled in tank or infantry.
## Transport Duty
Since TZK add "side-cheat CIV-like" transport helicopters, it's possible to recover AI transport by air again.
## AT Plane
AT plane will be filled within infantry group since there're always many slots.
## Nuke Plane
It's hard for AICO to have so much money to buy it. However if he has, and it's time to attack the base, AICO will buy nuke plane.
