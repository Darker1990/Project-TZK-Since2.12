"Vote" is learnt from mfcti 1.16 mission. After having introduced this it's unnecessary to remain huge items in param1/param2 defined in description.ext. Weather, game time, total game time limit, time boost, etc, can be "voted" in-game by players.
  Vote系统是从mfcti 1.16里学来的. 在引入它之后, 定义于description.ext的任务param1/param2不再需要保留大量的选项. 天气, 游戏时刻, 总时长, 天堂制造等, 可以在游戏内由玩家投票决定.
