; Although BIKI said that skipTime should executed on server, it requires being executed on all clients. So do those weather commands.

_DLapse = 60
_IncTime = ((24/_DLapse)/60)

; Time acceleration loop

#loop
_lastTime = time
~0.04

skipTime (_IncTime * (time - _lastTime))
? _time > 5*60: [] exec "Common\Loop\TimeBoost.sqs"; exit
