Mission version: @TZK_4.0.0;@TZK_4.0.3;@TZK_4.0.4;@TZK_4.0.5<br>
The last version of TZK supporting 1.96/1.99 is 2.10(mod) and 2.11A(missions, using 2.10 mod). Later in TZK_4 missions are modified to fit 1.99 aiming to provide mfcti/totalYugoWar mod version, but 1.96 is totally abandoned.<br>

The "TZK" is the MOD/MPMissions of CTI, which is developed basing on<br>
CRCTI_1.0_@RES2C3C8-irParaZ
The author optimized the design of CTI basing on his personal comprehension about CTI, added many practical functions and fixed discovered bugs. Since TZK_2.00, inspired by the "SE" mod of TZK, the author added some units and upgrades. And since TZK_2.12 the 2.01 Arma:Resistance is applied, which allows the author to design some MP-stable visual effects, edit strings, precisely check units ammunition, design radio channel as an enhancement of the action list, etc.
