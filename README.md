# Relationship between Project TZK_3 and TZK_2.12 MPMissions
The Protject TZK_3 is basing on @TZK_2.10 mod with TZK_2.11A MPMissions, applying 2.01 Arma Resistance by [4RTehch]. However TZK_3 missions cause stuck server by unknown reason, thus MPMissions are still using 2.11A version and MOD is still @TZK_2.10 bot not @TZK_3.00, and Missions are upgrading by adding new essentials gradually.
