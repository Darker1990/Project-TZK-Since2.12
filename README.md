# About Project TZK
The master branch of TZK MPMissions (not MOD) version is 1.00→1.01→1.02→1.10→2.00→2.11→2.12 (latest).  
There're 2.10 and 3.00 version MPMissions but they're failure. This 2 version missions cause no-response server. Probably the reason is "portable satchel" of which the "magazineType" is the only one modified parameter. This problem is solved by 2.12 v08 version. There is another trial 3.01, which didn't manage to solve this problem and thus be abandoned.  
2.00 is inspired by SE mod of TZK, and started to add new units, set new functions like spoof missile or afterburner, introduce new effects and upgrade the basic mission setting. Effects introduced into 2.00 mainly inspired by another Chinese MOD naming "ETON". Besides, "Join" and "Temporary Order" are the most important designs made in TZK_2.00.  
Since 2.12 the 2.01 Arma Resistance by [4RTech] is applied. Many new features are realized with the help of new script commands supported by Arma Resistance.  
## 2.01 ArmA:Resistance
2.01 is very useful to TZK. It provides many basic script commands. With the help of 3D-direction command, the author makes MP-stable visual effects. 2.01 also support editors editing strings. Combining magazinesArray, GetWeaponParam and GetWeaponSubParamArray, one can precisely check units ammunition and whether it's out of some weapons' ammo. Dynamic creating of markers, waypoints and triggers make mission.sqm tiny and editors able to design flexible radio channel system as an enhancement of the action list. And we might expect more, both for TZK and for 2.01.
# Gain MPMissions from Scripts on GitHub Directory
It's strongly recommended to use batch processing to copy files and make PBOs. The *MakePBO* of **Mikero Tools** is powerful.  
1. "xcopy" all files from "General Mission Scripts" to each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)".  
2. Package each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)" to PBO files.  
In old version MPMissions some pictures like .paa or .JPG are placed in missions' folder. They aren't uploaded to github, and hence files won't be included in source codes and pictures won't display in YOUR missions, but the game is able to play without them. Since 2.12S MPMissions read pictures from MOD (I moved them out of the mission), and MPMissions folder on github include scripts only.
