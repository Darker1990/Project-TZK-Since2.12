# The Project
TZK_3 is basing on @TZK_2.10 mod with TZK_2.11A MPMissions, applying 2.01 Arma Resistance by [4RTehch]. However TZK_3 missions cause no-response server by unknown reason, thus the project TZK_2.12 are only MPMissions using @TZK_2.10 MOD bot not @TZK_3.00, and Missions are upgrading by adding new essentials gradually. Up till 2.12H, many essentials are added and parts of problems are found. They're recorded in "LOG" folder and will be summarized in future.
# Gain MPMissions from Scripts Directory
It's strongly recommended to use batch processing to copy files and make PBOs. The MakePBO of Mikero Tools is powerful.
1. "xcopy" all files from "General Mission Scripts" to each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)".
2. Package each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)" to PBO files.

Pictures like .paa or .JPG are not uploaded to github, and hence files won't be included in source codes and pictures won't display in YOUR missions, but the game is able to play without them. Picture files are planned to be removed from MPMissions and placed in MOD in further projects.
It's not good remaining name of folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)" unchanged. Editors better rename them if edited scripts(name them at your own). Even though you make no modification rename is necessary because your missions are lacking of pictures, at least in 2.12 version.
