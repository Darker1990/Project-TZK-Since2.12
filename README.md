# About Project TZK
The master branch of TZK MPMissions (not MOD) version is 1.00→1.01→1.02→1.10→2.00→2.11→2.12 (latest).  
There're 2.10 and 3.00 version MPMissions but they're failure. Still remain partly unknown, this 2 version missions cause no-response server. There is another trial 3.01, which cause no-response server as well, but seldom, and not happened when player is many enough.  
Since 2.12P version of MPMissions, a new patch MOD, @TZK_2.12, is applied, and later MPMissions caused no-response server too. Probably the reason is because of the new mod, related to some islands, or has small probability because of some settings before 2.12P MPMissions.  
2.00 is inspired by SE mod of TZK, and started to add new units, set new functions like spoof missile or afterburner, introduce new effects and upgrade the basic mission setting.  
Since 2.12 the 2.01 Arma Resistance by [4RTech] is applied. Many new features are realized with the help of new script commands supported by Arma Resistance.
# Gain MPMissions from Scripts on GitHub Directory
It's strongly recommended to use batch processing to copy files and make PBOs. The MakePBO of Mikero Tools is powerful.  
1. "xcopy" all files from "General Mission Scripts" to each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)".  
2. Package each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)" to PBO files.  
In old version MPMissions some pictures like .paa or .JPG are placed in missions' folder. They aren't uploaded to github, and hence files won't be included in source codes and pictures won't display in YOUR missions, but the game is able to play without them. Since 2.12S MPMissions read pictures from MOD (I moved them out of the mission), and MPMissions folder on github include scripts only.
